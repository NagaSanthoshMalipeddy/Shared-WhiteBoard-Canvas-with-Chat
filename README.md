This project explains how SignalR works and how it helps solve the problem of fetching real-time application updates. It uses RPC (Remote Procedure Calls), which eliminates the need for clients to continuously send requests for updates. Instead, the server pushes updates to the client whenever there's new data. This ensures synchronized data and significantly faster data transfer, as RPC is approximately seven times faster than regular HTTP requests.

SignalR also overcomes the limitations commonly encountered with long polling when implementing real-time updates.

This project was developed using the Canvas API and SignalR.
