This project is to explain about How SignalR works, how we solve problem of fetching realtime application updates. This uses RPC( Remote Procedure Calls) which doesn't send any request to get updates but instead server will send updates to client if there's any update so that data is synchronous and data transfer is fast as RPC is 7 times daster than regular HTTP requests

This also overcomes the issue which we actually face when we use Long polling to get real time application updates

Canvas API, SignalR are used to develop this project
